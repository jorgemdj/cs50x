To recognize the aura of a songs.db file I would utilize a querry like this:

SELECT artists.name, AVG(energy) + AVG(valence) + AVG(danceability) AS aura FROM songs LEFT JOIN artists ON songs.artist_id = artists.id GROUP BY artists.name ORDER BY aura DESC LIMIT 2;

In that whay we get the 2 artists that influenced the most by sum of the averages from energy, valence and danceability values.

But, probably, we could get a better representation analysing those values separetly to the user relate more with his mood. For example: Bruno Mars was the one that had the greatest sum of averages, but it doesn't mean that he had the most danceability average.

So, if we want that the user relate with a danceability mood, we would be wrong to recommend Bruno Mars.

After checking all the individual averages, we could expose those analysis and only then show the most prominent moods represented by the artist that had the higher average value.
